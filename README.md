Shrine is a TempleOS distribution that aims to be more modern & approachable.

Shrine aims to improve upon TempleOS in several aspects:
- Approachability: Shrine ships with Lambda Shell, a more traditional Unix-like command interpreter
- Connectivity: TCP/IP stack! Internet access!
- Software access: Shrine includes a package downloader
- Versatility: unlike stock TempleOS, Shrine requires only 64MB RAM, making it feasible for cloud micro-instances and similar setups (note: this is planned, but currently not true)

Software included in Shrine:
- Mfa (minimalist file access)
- Lsh (Lambda Shell)
- Pkg (package downloader)
- Wget

Setting up with networking
==========================
- Native Stack (highly experimental)
  - configure your VM networking: *Adapter Type: PCnet-PCI II* (QEMU: `-netdev user,id=u1 -device pcnet,netdev=u1`)
  - *Attached to: NAT* seems to be the most reliable setting, Bridged Mode also works somewhat
  - On boot, Shrine will automatically attempt to acquire an IP address. If you don't get a message about "Configuring network", the adapter was not detected.

- To enable tunelled networking through Snail:
  - configure your VM: COM3 - TCP, server, 7777 (in VirtualBox, server = UNCHECK *Connect to existing*)
  - (make sure to *disable* networking for the VM, otherwise Native Stack will get precedence)
  - start the VM
  - run ./snail.py
  - you will now be able to access the Internet, try for example `pkg-list`

- To enable file access through Mfa, configure the VM as follows:
  - configure your VM: COM1 - TCP, server, 7770
  - start `/Apps/Mfa.HC.Z` in the VM
  - on the host, use ./mfa.py to transfer commands and files
  - for example: `./mfa.py list /Apps/Mfa.HC.Z Mfa.HC`

Both of these can be used simultaneously.

Package management functions
============================

Note: In Lsh, use `pkg-install xyz` in place of `PkgInstall("xyz")` etc.

- `PkgList;`

  List all packages available in the repository.

- `PkgInstall(U8* package_name);`

  Download & install a specific package.

- `PkgInstallFromFile(U8* manifest_path);`

  Manually install a downloaded package. Manifest must reference an existing .ISO.C path.

- `PkgMakeFromDir(U8* manifest_path, U8* src_dir);`

  Build a package from directory contents. For an example manifest, check [here](Shrine/Packages/Lsh/manifest). Manifest must reference a valid .ISO.C path which will be used as **output**!

- `PkgMakeFromFile(U8* manifest_path, U8* file_path);`

  Build a package from a single file. See above for details.
